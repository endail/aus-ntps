# aus-ntps
A collection of Australian NTP servers

The list below is generated by firstly `nslookup`ing the given endpoint to verify the host exists and then `ntpdig`ging it. Some endpoints may not have been accessible by the script which generates the list. For example, Aussie Broadband's NTP servers only respond to customers. The Australian Government's NTP servers are only available to [registered users](https://www.industry.gov.au/national-measurement-institute/physical-measurement-services/time-and-frequency-services).

Each table contains the following information:
- Endpoint: the hostname (or IP address) of the NTP server
- A/AAAA: `Y` indicates at least one A or AAAA DNS record exists for the given hostname
- IP Address: the IP address of the NTP server
- Stratum: the reported [stratum value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol#Clock_strata) of the NTP server

Use the Endpoint when configuring an NTP client or server. For example:

```conf
# /etc/ntpsec/ntp.conf
...
server tic.ntp.telstra.net iburst
```
